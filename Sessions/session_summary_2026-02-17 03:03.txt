---------------------------------
1. 4fa81f4 - docs: Add Providers/Models Catalog section to ARCHITECTURE.md

WHAT WAS DONE
-------------
1. ARCHITECTURE EVALUATION:
   - Delivered a full architecture evaluation of the project covering:
     project stats (100K TS lines, 75 pages, 201 server files, 27 domains),
     strengths (tRPC type safety, domain-organized server, unified catalog,
     hybrid routing, workspace isolation), issues and technical debt
     (monolithic routers.ts, god-file db.ts, schema.ts size, strict:false,
     route duplication, legacy code), security observations, scalability
     patterns, and frontend architecture concerns.
   - Provided prioritized recommendations (extract inline routers, split db.ts,
     clean dead code, add lazy loading, enable strict TS, add job queue,
     scope body parser limit).

2. ARCHITECTURE.MD UPDATE - Providers/Models Catalog:
   - Replaced the old "Model Management System" section with comprehensive
     "Providers and Models Catalog" documentation covering:
     * Unified Catalog (getUnifiedCatalog) - merges Hub Models + Provider Models
     * Provider Lifecycle table: Available → Configured → Active → Offline
     * Model Lifecycle table: Downloadable → Available → Active → Deprecated
     * Catalogue Page (LLMCataloguePage.tsx) - stats dashboard, search, grid
     * Consumer Pages table - 5 client pages using unified catalog
     * Policy Engine Integration - dynamic allowlist via getEnabledProviders()
     * Provider Routing - hybrid router with MODEL_QUALITY_TIERS
     * Key Files reference table (7 files with roles)
   - Fixed inaccurate "MySQL/TiDB" references to "PostgreSQL" in Storage Layer
     and Technology Stack Summary sections.

3. BUILD & DEPLOY:
   - Deployed version: 3.0.53
   - Tunnel URL: https://inherited-march-dividend-wales.trycloudflare.com
