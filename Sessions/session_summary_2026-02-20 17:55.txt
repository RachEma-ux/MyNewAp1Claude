Session Summary — 2026-02-20 17:55

## Focus: Deploy & Browser Test All Pages

### Deployed v3.0.163
- Triggered Builder Deploy workflow
- Cancelled duplicate run (22234939739), kept run 22234942775
- Tunnel URL: https://corrected-probability-ons-blend.trycloudflare.com
- Build took longer than usual (~4 min) but completed successfully

### Bulk Page Testing
- Opened open-all-tunnel.html to test all 27 pages at once
- Browser popup blocker initially blocked tabs — user allowed popups and reloaded
- All 27 pages opened successfully in browser tabs

### Updated open-all-tunnel.html (local only)
- Rewrote client/public/open-all-tunnel.html with a button-click approach
- Big "Open All 27 Pages" button triggers window.open from user click (bypasses popup blockers)
- Includes fallback links at bottom
- Dark themed UI
- Note: This change is local only, not yet on a deployed tunnel (will be included in next deploy)

### No Bug Fixes This Session
- All previous fixes (state machine, modal close, base URL auto-fill) already committed and pushed
- This session was deploy + browser testing only

### Sandbox Issues
- /tmp permission errors (EACCES) persisted — sleep, termux-open-url blocked in sandbox
- Workaround: used `am start` Android intent for opening URLs
