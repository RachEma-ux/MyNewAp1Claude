## Changes Made

### 1. Fix scraped provider names & descriptions (commit b799bea)
- Improved `cleanTitle()` in `server/routers/discover-provider.ts` to split on common title separators (|, –, —, " - ") and pick the shortest ≤4-word segment as the brand name
- Added `cleanDescription()` to truncate long descriptions at 200 chars with sentence boundary awareness
- Applied cleaning to both Phase 1 quick-fetch and Phase 2 full-parse extraction paths
- Fixed existing dirty catalog entries via tRPC:
  - id=123: "Hugging Face – The AI community building the future." → "Hugging Face"
  - id=134: "Connect, protect, and build everywhere | Cloudflare" → "Cloudflare"
  - id=126: "WRITER" → "Writer"
  - id=128: Cleaned Reka AI description (removed \n, trimmed)

### 2. Catalog import wizard duplicate detection (commit e2c4b9a)
- Added duplicate detection to CatalogImportWizard.tsx
- Shows "Exists" badge instead of Register button for providers already in catalog
- Prevents duplicate registrations in both single and batch import flows

### 3. Claude Code permanent permissions setup

  Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch, NotebookEdit,
