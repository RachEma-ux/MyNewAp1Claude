(Continuation of session 2026-02-18 19:16)

## Focus: Taxonomy Documentation, Agent Ontology, Testing Tools, Deploy

### Commits Made (4)

1. **5393b39** — `docs: Add AI Platform Compliance Design Matrix to catalog taxonomy`
   - 5-layer governance framework (Provider, LLM, Model, Agent, Bot)
   - Cross-layer controls, compliance hierarchy, governance principles
   - +165 lines

2. **f933910** — `feat: Add bulk page testing HTML launchers`
   - open-all-local.html — opens 28 pages on localhost:3000
   - open-all-tunnel.html — opens 28 pages on tunnel URL
   - Uses window.open() to launch all tabs from one page load
   - Served via Vite dev server (client/public/)

3. **13d9185** — `docs: Rename 'Term' to 'Type' in taxonomy entities table header`
   - 1 word changed in Five Entities table

4. **66940e9** — `docs: Add Agent Ontology + Multi-Axis Classification Model to taxonomy`
   - Clean Unified Agent Ontology: 9 categories, 40 sub-categories, 102 classes
     - Cognitive Architecture (20 classes)
     - Functional Role (19 classes)
     - Organizational Structure (8 classes)
     - Autonomy Level (7 classes)
     - Embodiment (6 classes)
     - Learning Paradigm (15 classes)
     - Decision Paradigm (9 classes)
     - Governance & Safety (9 classes)
     - Cognitive Capability (9 classes)
   - Multi-Axis Classification Model: rationale for vertical panel UI
     - Agents classified across all 9 dimensions simultaneously
     - 6 architectural benefits documented
   - +289 lines

### Testing Innovation: Bulk Page Launcher
- Problem: termux-open-url opens one URL at a time, switching between apps
- Solution: HTML files with window.open() served by dev server
- One termux-open-url call opens 28 tabs at once
- Files: client/public/open-all-local.html, open-all-tunnel.html
- Saved to memory (testing-tools-tips.md) as reusable technique

### Taxonomy File Structure (shared/catalog-taxonomy.ts)
The file now contains 6 documentation sections (all as comments):
1. Five Fundamentally Different Entities table
2. Clean Comparison Table (10-row feature matrix)
3. AI Platform Compliance Design Matrix (5-layer governance)
4. Clean Unified Agent Ontology (9 categories, 102 classes)
5. Multi-Axis Agent Classification Model (UI architecture rationale)
6. Architectural Stack diagram

### Duplicate Analysis
- Identified 4 cross-axis near-duplicate pairs in Agent Ontology:
  - Theory-of-Mind Architecture (Cat 1) vs Theory-of-Mind (Cat 9)
  - Model-Based RL Architecture (Cat 1) vs Model-Based RL (Cat 6)
  - Reinforcement-Based Architecture (Cat 1) vs Reinforcement Learning (Cat 6)
  - Federated System (Cat 3) vs Federated Learning (Cat 6)
- Not true duplicates — same concept from different angles (architecture vs paradigm vs capability)
- Solution designed: namespaced storage keys, distinct display labels, cross-axis inference rules

### Architecture Decision: Agent Wizard Implementation
- Comments = design spec for humans (documentation only)
- DB = runtime source of truth for code (queryable, versionable, admin-editable)
- Planned schema:
  - agent_taxonomy_axes (~9 rows)
  - agent_taxonomy_subcategories (~40 rows)
  - agent_taxonomy_classes (102 rows)
  - agent_taxonomy_inference_rules (~4 rows)
- Wizard UI reads from DB, not hardcoded arrays
- Agent entries store 9-axis classification as structured JSON
- Soft versioning via active boolean on classes
- NOT yet implemented — design phase only

### Deploys
- Builder Deploy triggered: run 22152930416
- Tunnel: https://wonderful-avatar-psychological-empty.trycloudflare.com
- Version 3.0.101

### Infrastructure
- Dev server running on http://localhost:3000
- Ollama running with 3 models
- PostgreSQL running locally
- 6 providers loaded
