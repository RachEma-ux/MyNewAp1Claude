Session Summary - 2026-02-17 12:25

## Features Implemented

### 1. Auto-discover provider models on creation (implemented then rolled back)
- Modified `server/providers/router.ts` to auto-discover models from providers on creation
- After `registerProvider()`, called `getSupportedModels()` to get discovered models
- Updated provider config with `models` and `defaultModel` for catalogue visibility
- Inserted each model into `models` DB table for Models Hub visibility
- Embedding model detection via `/embed/` regex pattern
- **Rolled back** (reverted both commits) per user request due to catalogue display issues

### 2. Catalogue page - Separate Providers and Models sections
- Replaced the single flat grid with two distinct sections:
  - **Providers section**: One card per provider with blue "Provider" badge, type, endpoint, Local/Cloud location, model count, Active/Disabled status, priority
  - **Models section**: One card per model with "Model" badge, purpose-built info, provider name, category
- Commit: `9d35814`

### 3. Enhanced model cards with Purpose-built, Governance, and Hub status
- Replaced "Available via..." with Purpose-built field (`bestFor` from catalogue data), showing "Purpose-built: empty" if not set
- Added Governance check: purple "Governance" badge if model name matches an LLM identity, or "Not in Governance" otherwise
- Added Hub check: green "Hub" badge if model exists in models DB table, or "Not in Hub" otherwise
- Added ShieldCheck/ShieldX icons for governance indicators
- Commit: `00eefd0`

### 4. Manage button on Catalogue page
- Added "Manage" button top-right aligned with "Catalogue" title
- Created `/llm/catalogue/manage` route with "Coming soon" landing page
- Added `useLocation` import to App.tsx for navigation
- Commit: `e8ce7ac`

### 5. Created test provider "WWWWWZ PROV" and "NEW PROVIDER 3+" with custom models
- WWWWWZ PROV: auto-discovered tinyllama, phi3, nomic-embed-text from Ollama
- NEW PROVIDER 3+: manually configured with Model 1, Midel 2, Midel 3

## Technical Notes
- `tsx watch` does NOT auto-reload on Android/Termux - server must be manually restarted after code changes
- Dev server restarted by killing PIDs and running `nohup npm run dev`
- `am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW` works for opening URLs when `termux-open-url` fails in sandbox
