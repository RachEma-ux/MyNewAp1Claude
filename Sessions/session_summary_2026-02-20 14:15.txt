## Focus: Deploy & Test Base URL Auto-Fill Fix

### Deployed and Tested
- Deployed v3.0.161 via Builder Deploy with 30-min tunnel
- Opened /providers/connections in browser
- Confirmed Base URL auto-fills when selecting a provider (e.g., OpenAI → https://api.openai.com)
- The registryId fix from previous session (efe829e) is working correctly

### PAT Auto-Fill Clarification
- User reported PAT field doesn't auto-fill for OpenAI
- Investigated: providers table is empty (0 rows)
- Root cause: OPENAI_API_KEY GitHub secret is not configured (only GIST_TOKEN exists)
- The auto-provision code (server/_core/index.ts:115) runs at startup but skips
  when env vars are empty
- Each tunnel deploy uses a fresh PostgreSQL container — all data lost on expiry
- On production with persistent DB, PATs stored via Connect flow will persist
- User confirmed this is understood and acceptable — no fix needed

### No Code Changes
- All fixes were committed and pushed in the previous session
- This session was deploy + manual browser testing only

### Commits (from previous session, already pushed)
- c610f2e fix: Allow disabled→active transition and keep success screen visible
- efe829e fix: Auto-fill Base URL by reading config.registryId fallback
