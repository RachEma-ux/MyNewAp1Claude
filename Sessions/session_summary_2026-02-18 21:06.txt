## Focus: Taxonomy Design Documentation — Full Ontology Spec

### Commits Made (4)

1. **5393b39** — `docs: Add AI Platform Compliance Design Matrix to catalog taxonomy`
   - 5-layer governance framework (+165 lines)

2. **f933910** — `feat: Add bulk page testing HTML launchers`
   - open-all-local.html + open-all-tunnel.html in client/public/

3. **13d9185** — `docs: Rename 'Term' to 'Type' in taxonomy entities table header`

4. **66940e9** — `docs: Add Agent Ontology + Multi-Axis Classification Model to taxonomy`
   - 9 categories, 40 sub-categories, 102 classes
   - Multi-axis vertical panel rationale (+289 lines)

5. **745eba5** — `docs: Add file concept, multi-type axes design, and versioning strategy`
   - Section 1: File concept (comments = spec, DB = runtime truth)
   - Section 2: Multi-dimensional axes for all 5 types
   - Section 3.1: Versioning concern
   - Section 3.2: Soft approach chosen (+77 lines)

6. **7662758** — `docs: Add 4 guard-rail rules to taxonomy file concept section`
   - Don't mix comments and DB
   - Don't flatten multi-dimensional types
   - Don't invent your own schema (4 tables)
   - Don't over-engineer versioning

### Taxonomy File Final Structure (shared/catalog-taxonomy.ts)
Now contains 7 documentation sections as comments:
1. File Concept + 4 Guard-Rail Rules
2. The Natural Way (multi-axis for all 5 types + DB schema)
3. Concept Limit (versioning) + Chosen Solution (soft approach)
4. Five Fundamentally Different Entities table
5. Clean Comparison Table (10-row feature matrix)
6. AI Platform Compliance Design Matrix (5-layer governance)
7. Clean Unified Agent Ontology (9 categories, 102 classes)
8. Multi-Axis Agent Classification Model (UI architecture rationale)
9. Architectural Stack diagram

### Key Design Decisions Made (no code yet)
- Agent wizard: vertical multi-axis panel (9 independent selectors)
- All 5 types get multi-axis classification, not just Agent
- DB tables: taxonomy_axes, taxonomy_subcategories, taxonomy_classes, taxonomy_inference_rules
- Generic <MultiAxisPanel type={entryType}> component for all types
- Soft versioning: active boolean on classes (no version column)
- Namespaced storage keys to avoid cross-axis duplicates
- Cross-axis inference rules as DB data, not hardcoded logic

### Duplicate Analysis (Agent Ontology)
- 102 total classes across 9 axes
- 4 cross-axis near-duplicate pairs identified
- Solution: namespaced keys + distinct display labels + inference rules

### Deploys
- Tunnel was live: https://wonderful-avatar-psychological-empty.trycloudflare.com (v3.0.101)
- All pages tested via bulk launcher HTML files

### Testing Innovation
- Bulk page launcher: HTML files with window.open() served by Vite
- Saved to memory/testing-tools-tips.md as reusable technique

### Infrastructure
- Dev server: http://localhost:3000
- Ollama: 3 models
- PostgreSQL: running locally
- 6 providers loaded
