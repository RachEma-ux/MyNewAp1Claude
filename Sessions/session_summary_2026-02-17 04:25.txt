Session Summary — 2026-02-17 04:25 UTC

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Crashes due to zombie dev server processes
- Found 6 duplicate `npm run dev` / tsx server instances consuming ~1.4 GB RAM
- Killed all, freeing memory from 438 MB → 1.9 GB free
- Root cause: processes not cleanly stopped between sessions

### 2. 404 on NewProviderPage after saving provider
- `NewProviderPage.tsx` navigated to `/llm/provider-wizard` which had no route
- Fixed: changed to `navigate("/llm")` (both success redirect and Back button)

### 3. 404 on LLMCreationWizard after creating project
- `LLMCreationWizard.tsx` navigated to `/llm/creation/${id}` — route doesn't exist
- User saw: "404 Page Not Found — Path: /llm/creation/6"
- Fixed: changed to `navigate("/llm")`
- Added debug path display to NotFound.tsx to help diagnose future 404s

### 4. Created LLMs not showing in Catalogue page
- `/llm/catalogue` only showed hub models + provider models from unified catalog
- Added `trpc.llm.list` and `trpc.llm.listCreationProjects` queries
- Added "Registered LLMs" section with purple LLM badges (clickable → /llm/:id)
- Added "Creation Projects" section with status, base model, phase info
- Updated stats row: replaced "Coming soon" with actual LLM and Project counts
- Search filter works across all sections

## Other Actions
- Started dev server on localhost:3000, ollama serve on :11434
- Created provider "protst" (ID: 8, type: local-ollama) via tRPC API
- Deployed twice via Builder Deploy workflow:
  - v3.0.57: https://snap-investigate-prescription-ice.trycloudflare.com
  - v3.0.59: https://submitted-concentrate-firms-andrew.trycloudflare.com (with all fixes)

## Architecture Understanding: Model Entry Points
- Hub Models: hardcoded `HUB_MODELS` array in `server/models/download-router.ts`
- Provider Models: dynamic from `getEnabledProviders()` → each provider's `config.models`
- Unified Catalog (`getUnifiedCatalog`): merges Hub + Provider models at query time
- LLM Identities (`/llm/wizard`): governance layer on top, not part of catalog (now shown in catalogue page)
- Creation Projects (`/llm/create`): LLM training project tracker
